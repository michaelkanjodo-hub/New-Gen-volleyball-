## 🗄️ Data layer

All data is persisted in **`localStorage`** under the key `gzvm_data_v2`. The storage layer is in `js/app.js` (`APP.data`, `APP.save`, `APP.load`).

### 🌐 Cross-device sync (Supabase)

By default, each browser is its own silo. To make team names, profile photos, registrations, chat, donations, leaderboard, and live streams **sync live across every device**:

1. Create a free project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Open **SQL Editor** → paste the contents of `supabase-setup.sql` → Run
3. Go to **Settings → API** and copy your "Project URL" and "anon public" key
4. Paste both into `js/supabase-sync.js`:
   ```js
   config: {
     url: 'https://xxxxx.supabase.co',
     anonKey: 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...'
   }
   ```
5. Refresh the site. You'll see a **green ● SYNC** badge in the navbar.

**What syncs in real time:**
- Team names + logos
- Player names + profile photos
- Player registrations (waivers, medical forms go to Supabase Storage)
- Match scores, results, and bookings
- Donations & donation progress bar
- Live stream rooms
- Chat messages
- Skill progress updates
- Leaderboard ranks
- Strategy videos + coach feedback

**How it works:** The `gzvm_sync` table holds one row per entity (team/player/match/etc) with the full JSON payload. When any device calls `APP.save()`, the new data is upserted to Supabase. A realtime subscription on every device fires `APP.handleChange()` when remote writes come in, which updates local state and triggers a re-render.

### To swap in a different real backend (Firebase / custom API)

The entire data layer is centralized in `js/app.js`. To migrate to another service:

1. Replace `APP.load()` and `APP.save()` with your service's read/write
2. Replace `APP.register()` / `APP.login()` with your auth provider
3. Add `currentUser()` listener via your auth provider's state-change event

The rest of the app reads/writes through `APP.data` so the rest of the code stays the same.
